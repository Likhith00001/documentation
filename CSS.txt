Basic structure of css
selector {
  property: value;
  property: value;
}
Selector: This part points to the HTML element(s) you want to style. Selectors can target elements by their tag name (e.g., p, h1), class (e.g., .my-class), or ID (e.g., #my-id).
Declaration Block: This is enclosed in curly braces ({}) and contains one or more declarations.
Declaration: Each declaration is a pair of a property and a value, separated by a colon (:).
Property: The style attribute you want to change (e.g., color, font-size, margin).
Value: The specific setting for the property (e.g., blue, 16px, auto).
Semicolon (;): Used to separate multiple declarations within a declaration block. The last declaration in a block doesn't technically need one, but it is considered best practice to always include it for consistency and easier code maintenance. 
example:
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
