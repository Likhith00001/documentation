<!DOCTYPE html>	A declaration that tells the browser the document type and version (HTML5 for the modern web).
<html>	The root element that wraps all other elements in the document. It often includes a lang attribute to declare the page's primary language for accessibility and search engines.
<head>	A container for metadata (data about the document) that is not displayed on the webpage itself. Key elements inside it include:
     <meta charset="UTF-8">	Specifies the character encoding to handle most characters correctly.
     <meta name="viewport">	Essential for responsive design on mobile devices.
     <title>	Defines the title of the document, which appears in the browser's tab or window title bar and is important for SEO and bookmarks.
     <link> / <style>	Links external CSS stylesheets or embeds styles directly.
     <script>	Links external JavaScript files or embeds scripts (often placed at the end of the <body> for performance).
<body>	Contains all the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, links, headings, and paragraphs.

<header>: Represents introductory content or a group of navigational links, usually at the top of the page or a section.
<nav>: Defines a block of major navigation links.
<main>: Contains the unique content central to the current page. It should only appear once per page and be a direct child of the <body>.
<article>: Encloses independent, self-contained content, such as a blog post or news story.
<section>: Groups together content that constitutes a single thematic part of the page, typically with a heading.
<aside>: Contains content that is related to the main content but separate from it (like a sidebar, glossary, or author bio).
<footer>: Defines a footer for the document or a section, often containing copyright information, contact details, or related links.
